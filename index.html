            <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>Hello, my name is Elijah Joseph. I am 31 years old and
            am currently on my way to become a software developer.
            My hobbies include gaming, watching professional sports,
             and playing sports. My favorite sport to watch and play
             is basketball.<br><br>
             I really enjoy coding as well. To be able
             to create something like a website, and then watch it 
             come to life is an amazing and very rewarding feeling.
             My goal is to be a successful web developer at a big tech
             company one day.<br><br>
             I also have my Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science 
             from Azusa Pacific University. I graduated in 2016,
             decided that I wanted to be an entrepreneur, so I did
             Uber driving for a while. I now do full-time driving 
             for Grubhub, but want to get back into software engineering,
             so I am currently re-learning how to code.
             <br><br> 
             The website that I am using to learn how
             to code is Codecademy.com. Codecademy is an amazing website
             to learn how to code and I highly recommend it to anyone
             that wants to learn how to code. Welcome to my website!

            <h3>Here are a few of my projects</h3>
            <h4>Credit Card Validator</h4>
            <p>The credit card validator will take in a credit card number 
                and print out whether the card number is a valid credit card
                number or not.
                <p>HINT: Do not use a real credit card number for security reasons,
                    instead look up fake credit card numbers that can be both
                    valid or invalid to use the validator.
