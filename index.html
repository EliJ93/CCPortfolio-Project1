            <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>Hello, my name is Elijah Joseph. I am 31 years old and
            am currently on my way to become a software developer.
            My hobbies include gaming, watching professional sports,
             and playing sports. My favorite sport to watch and play
             is basketball.<br><br>
             I really enjoy coding as well. To be able
             to create something like a website, and then watch it 
             come to life is an amazing and very rewarding feeling.
             My goal is to be a successful web developer at a big tech
             company one day.<br><br>
             I also have my Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science 
             from Azusa Pacific University. I graduated in 2016,
             decided that I wanted to be an entrepreneur, so I did
             Uber driving for a while. I now do full-time driving 
             for Grubhub, but want to get back into software engineering,
             so I am currently re-learning how to code.
             <br><br> 
             The website that I am using to learn how
             to code is Codecademy.com. Codecademy is an amazing website
             to learn how to code and I highly recommend it to anyone
             that wants to learn how to code. Welcome to my website!

        <div class="projects" id="projects">
            <h3>Here are a few of my projects</h3>
            <h4>Credit Card Validator</h4>
            <p>The credit card validator will take in a credit card number 
                and print out whether the card number is a valid credit card
                number or not. For this project I used JavaScript to take in 
                the user input and check to see if the card number is valid
                or not.</p>
                <p>HINT: Do not use a real credit card number for security reasons,
                    instead look up fake credit card numbers that can be both
                    valid or invalid to use the validator.
                </p>
            </p>
            <form action="" method="#">
            <label for="creditCardInput">Credit Card:</label>
            <input name="creditCardInput" id="creditCardInput" type="text" 
            placeholder="Ex:1234567891234567" required pattern="[0-9]{14-16}">
            <input type="submit" value="Submit" name="submit" id="submit">
            </form>

            <button class="creditCardButton" id="creditCardButton">Check Validation</button>
            <p class="valid-message" id="valid-message">This will tell if the credit card is valid or not.</p>
            <h4>Random Message Generator</h4>
            <p>Click the button below to generate a random message. 
                For this project I used JavaScript to make the website
                print out a random message every time the random message
                generator button is clicked.</p>
            <button class="randomButton" id="randomButton">Make A Random Message!</button>
            <p class="randomMessage" id="randomMessage"></p>
        </div>
        <h3>Tea Shop Website</h3>
        <p>With the Tea Shop Website, I created a website for a
            tea shop. I used HTML and CSS to create the website.
